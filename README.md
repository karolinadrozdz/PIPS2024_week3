"my_functions" is a file that includes two basic functions.

    The remind.me() function, which provides a reminder of the groceries I need to do the following day. This function does not require any arguments and returns a list.
    The cheat() function, designed to assist in cheating on an exam for three questions. It takes an 'exercise' argument, which accepts the values 6, 9, or 16, and it returns the corresponding answers. Example: cheat(6). 
      For exercises other than 6,9,16 it returns the info: "No solution available for this exercise."
